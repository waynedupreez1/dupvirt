# Introduction
This project does the following:

1. Switch on a virt VM based on either magic packets or arp messages sent to the machines host
2. Switch off the virt VM once traffic to it dies down

# Whats the point

Well I have a windows game streaming machine on my network which I want to switch on and off
automatically based on usage.
